This is a move recommender RAG system I put together to learn some data engineering and AI integration. The name is a double reference to Roger Ebert, one of the greatest movie critics of all time, and to the Google BERT language model used to answer queries. 

Metholdology:
I am really proud of the data engineering and AI implementation I did. I took a basic-ish dataset from Kaggle and went from there to format and clean the data. Then, I used a chromaDB vector database to embed the data. After that, I implemented BERT to answer only the titles of the movies and complete the RAG functionality.

Future:
The biggest future goal I have for this project is making a frontend for it. I plan to use React to do this as simply and seamlessly as possible. Also, as you can see in the notebook, I plan to use Pytube to implement movie clips for this future website. A longer goal of mine is to try out different models (Llama?) and datasets(imdb API?) to grow the project.
